    <body>
    My name is Jonathan Thomas.  My major is Computer Science and I am interested in software engineering with a focus on the front end of the stack.  I am a proficient coder in Java and Python, and will be interning with L3Harris this summer as a Software Engineer.  I am a sports fanatic, involved with Otto’s Army on campus which supports my love for Syracuse Athletics. I also love playing video games with my friends, and can give anyone the work in FIFA, Madden, 2K, Call of Duty you name it. I love the competition, especially with my friends as it always makes for a fun time. I’ve always loved creating things whether it be in an engineering or software sense, I love being able to build things from scratch.
